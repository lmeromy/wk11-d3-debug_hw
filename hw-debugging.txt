What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
It is where code will pause and launch a debugger console.

Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
No! It pauses before that line of code is executed.

How do we debug the next line of code?
Click on "Step Over" and the line will run and pause on the next line of code

What does the step into command do?
Instead of executing that code, it will step into the code and pause on the first line of the method.

What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
Evaluate expression will just run one expression (no need for semicolons). Evaluate code fragment will run multiple expressions (need semicolons).
